# TypeScript-Pixel-Smile

## Description
This program generates and displays a simple pixel-based face in the console using ASCII characters. It simulates a 2D image by storing pixel states in a boolean array and provides drawing functions for rectangles, lines, and individual pixels.

## Coding Techniques
- Representing 2D image data using a 1D boolean array
- Converting 2D coordinates to a 1D array index
- Modular drawing functions for dots, lines, and rectangles
- Boundary checking to prevent out-of-range pixel access
- Loops for rendering horizontal and vertical shapes
- Console-based visualization using characters

## Example Output
```
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
X                  X
X      X    X      X
